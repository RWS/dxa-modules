The parents share incubation, changing duty daily. The eggs hatch after 34\n               to 36 days. The chicks remain in the nests for about 30 days before forming creches. The chicks molt into sub-adult plumage\n               and go out to sea at about 80 to 100 days. \n               \t \n            </p>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"TOPIC_27E5CE5A484D4E358E913EEB88683598__FIG_4329BB14742246DB90061FE65BD51C71\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"TOPIC_27E5CE5A484D4E358E913EEB88683598__IMAGE_E47436D29D5F44FB8ED5A56E3CF00FFE\" height=\"600\" width=\"682\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-515018-16.jpg\" /> \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"topic nested1\" aria-labelledby=\"TOPIC_420457F2FAD4461D8ACD08BB1F4CBF3F__GUID-6AA46FD8-27B2-4B30-B1C1-2CB58519379B\" id=\"TOPIC_420457F2FAD4461D8ACD08BB1F4CBF3F\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> \n         \n         <h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"TOPIC_420457F2FAD4461D8ACD08BB1F4CBF3F__GUID-6AA46FD8-27B2-4B30-B1C1-2CB58519379B\">Diet</h2>\n         \n         \n         <div class=\"body\"> \n            \t \n            <p class=\"p\">Gentoos live mainly on crustaceans such as krill, with fish making up only about 15% of the diet.
