They arrive in the colony to court end September-November. Once pairs are made, the female lays 2 eggs in November-December\n                  which will be incubated by both parents in \"shifts\" of 5 à 10 days. The eggs hatch after 33 till 35 days and the chicks remain\n                  in the nest for another 20 à 30 days, before they gather in crèches. There they stay for some weeks, being fed daily. The\n                  chicks moult to their juvenile plumage and leave the nest in end February-March after 50 à 60 days.
