They have a black stripe\n               and black spots on the chest, the pattern of spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. They have pink\n               glands above their eyes, which are used for thermoregulation. The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these\n               glands so it may be cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            This species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism: the males are larger than the females and have larger beaks. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             The beak is more pointed than that of the Humboldt. Their distinctive black and white colouring is a vital form of camouflage\n               called countershading- white for underwater predators looking upwards and black for predators looking down onto the dark water.\n               African penguins look very similar to the Humboldt penguins. African penguins have a very recognizable appearance with a thick\n               band of black that is in the shape of an upside-down horseshoe. They have unique black spots that vary in size and shape per\n               penguin. Magellanic Penguins share a similar characteristic that often confuses the two, the similarity is a double bar on\n               the throat and chest. The penguins have the nickname, the \"Jackass penguin\", they got their nickname from the loud noises\n               they make. They stand about 27 inches (60 cm tall) and weigh from 7 to 11 lbs. (2.5 to 5 kg). \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Distribution\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n             \n               \t\t\n               The African penguin is found on the south-western coast of Africa, living in colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa\n                  Bay, near Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

Mainland colonies probably only became possible in recent times due to the reduction\n                  of predator numbers, although the Betty's Bay colony has been attacked by leopards.

A penguin may consume up to 540 grams of prey every day, but this may increase to over\n                  1 kg when raising older chicks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Due to the collapse of a commercial pilchard fishery in 1960, the African penguin has resorted to eating anchovies. Although\n                  it keeps the penguins alive, it is not their ideal meal due to the low concentration of fat and protein. Their diet changes\n                  throughout the year and it is believed that their aspect of breeding help the penguins maintain their population size. Upon\n                  having hatchlings, although the parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, the parents will not sacrifice their appetite\n                  for their children. If even in a situation where food is scarce, adult parents will let their children starve before they\n                  let themselves starve. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The African penguin is monogamous. It breeds in colonies, and pairs return to the same site each year. The African penguin\n                  has an extended breeding season, with nesting usually peaking from March to May in South Africa, and November and December\n                  in Namibia. A clutch of two eggs are laid either in burrows dug in guano, or scrapes in the sand under boulders or bushes.\n                  Incubation is undertaken equally by both parents for about 40 days. At least one parent guards the chicks until about 30 days,\n                  whereafter the chick joins a creche with other chicks, and both parents head out to sea to forage each day. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Chicks fledge at 60 to 130 days, the timing depending on environmental factors such as quality and availability of food. The\n                  fledged chick then go to sea on their own and return to their natal colony after a lengthy time period of 12-22 months to\n                  molt into adult plumage. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               When penguins molt, they are unable to forage as their new feathers are not waterproof yet; therefore they fast over the entire\n                  molting period, which in African penguins takes about 20 days. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The African penguin's lifespan consists of mainly breeding.The aim of their existence is basically to produce strong and fertile\n                  offspring in order to keep their species alive, and females remain fertile for 10 years. Penguins spend most of their lives\n                  at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals inland, the penguins will\n                  go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African\n                  winter when temperatures are less torrid. Although it is winter, the heat on the island is still scorching. The penguins need\n                  to find protection for their eggs. In order to do this; they dig guano holes and incubate the penguins there. Due to humans,\n                  though, the amount of guano on the land has significantly dropped. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand. Although\n                  effective, the sand gets hot and fills with water during rain easily. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for\n                  their offsprings. The eggs are 3-4 times bigger than hen's eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

They have a very large yellow bill, with a\n            green tip and greyish-brown legs. There are two different morphs, the dark which resembles the northern giant petrel, and\n            the more distinct light morph. On the dark morph the upper breast, head and neck are light with the remainder of its plumage\n            being mottled brown. The leading edge of its wing is lighter as is the base of the inner primaries, on the underside. The\n            light morph is rarer and very distinct with only slight black speckles on an otherwise all white look. As juveniles, the dark\n            morph starts off more sooty brown and pales as it ages. Both giant petrels have strong legs and can move around on land effectively.\n            Finally, when in flight this species has a somewhat hunchbacked appearance. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Like all members of the Procellariiformes, they have certain features that set them apart from other birds.

The bills of all Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates.\n            Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can\n            be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as used as an energy rich food source for chicks and\n            for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate\n            their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe; it excretes a concentrated saline solution from the\n            nostrils. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         For more information: \n            \t\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_giant_petrel\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Petrels\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

It may be derived from the Welsh pen gwyn\n            \"white head\", although the etymology is debated. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the\n            Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the Great Auk of the northern hemisphere, and named them after\n            this bird, although they are not related.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The etymology of the word \"penguin\" is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, nor of Breton or Spanish\n            origin (both attributed to the French word pingouin \"auk\"), but first appears in English or Dutch.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, \"head\" and gwyn, \"white\", including the Oxford English Dictionary,\n            the American Heritage Dictionary, the Century Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, on the basis that the name was originally applied\n            to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because it had white\n            circles around its eyes (though the head was black).\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis which means \"fat\". In Dutch the alternative word for penguin is 'fat-goose'\n            ('vetgans' see: Dutch wiki or dictionaries under Pinguïn), and would indicate this bird received its name from its appearance.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",
